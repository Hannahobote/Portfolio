# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio v.1

I have decided to make a simple static webpage for my first portfolio. The second version of my porfolio will be made with vue.js. The reason for that is becuase I want to have reusable components such as the header, navigation bar and the footer. This will make futrue versions easier to make. I also want to use the vue routes and get a hang of that. But for now, This will do.Made with bootsrap as well.
